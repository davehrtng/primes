# primes
Command line app that computes all prime numbers less than 100.

This is re-implementation of a college Lisp project to practice JavaScript. I don't have the original Lisp source code, so it is a complete re-write, not a port. The assignment description is [here](https://blue.butler.edu/~jsorenso/opl/index.php?page=projscheme).
